## Our Mission
We are a student-run organization dedicated to the welfare of stray animals on our campus. We believe in coexistence, compassion, and care. Our goal is to ensure every animal on campus is healthy, vaccinated, and treated with kindness.

## What We Do
- **Daily Feeding:** Providing nutritious meals twice a day.
- **Vaccination Drives:** Annual Anti-Rabies and 7-in-1 vaccinations.
- **Sterilization (ABC):** Collaborating with local NGOs for Animal Birth Control.
- **Medical Care:** On-spot treatment for minor injuries and transport for critical cases.
- **Adoption:** Finding forever homes for puppies and abandoned pets.

## Join Us
We are always looking for more hands to help! Whether you can spare an hour a week for feeding or want to help with social media, there is a place for you at PAWS.
